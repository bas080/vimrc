# Vimstinct
An opiniated vimrc that I use in my vimventures.

> You might not end up using this vimrc, but you might steal some things that
> are usefull for you.

## Documentation
Take your time to browse the [docs](documentation.md). It shows all the keybindings and some
explanations.

## Roadmap
- Generate docs using the comments in the vim files
- Setup script for adding the path of vimstinct
- Keep extending the keybindings for javascipt
